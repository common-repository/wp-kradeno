msgid "You could start a report check here. Note that it may take at least 10 minutes. This depends on the number of posts you have, their size and on the speed of your server. If you have a lot of posts, you may run out of Google API calls (how many requests it's save to send to Google). In this case, you could run the check an hour later and it will continue from where it ended. The checking algorithm will skip all posts that were checked in the last 6 hours. You may override this by marking the force checkbox."
